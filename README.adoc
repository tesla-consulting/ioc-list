Here are indicators of compromise (IOCs) of our various investigations. We are
doing this to help the broader security community fight malicious IP wherever it
might be.

If you would like to contribute improved versions please send us a pull
request.

If you've found false positives give us the details in an issue report and
we'll try to improve our IOCs.
